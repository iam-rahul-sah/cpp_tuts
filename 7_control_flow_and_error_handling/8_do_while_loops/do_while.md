# Do while loop

A `do while` statement is a looping construct that works just like a while loop, execpt that the statement always executes at least once. After the statement has be executed, the `do-while` check the condition in the while statement. If the condition is true, the statement is executed again. This process continues until the condition is false.


**Syntax**
```
do
{
    // statements
}while(condition);
```
